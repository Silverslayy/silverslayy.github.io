									<p>As I increasingly became aware of how different the level of education kids in the slums were receiving, I knew I wanted to do something to help. I wouldn't be able to change the education systen, but I could atleast make sure they do get an education. </p>

									<p>I used the SHOFCO fundraising link and venmo. And did most of the fundraisng on Parents Weekend, saturday games and by personally talking to people. The SHOFCO fundraising link was also sent to every student and faculty at Taft with the explanatory video attatched to it. I fundraised approximately $2,500 in 7 months which helped support 62 kids.</p>

									<p>I started by mapping out the two schools and students I wanted to reach out to through the project. I visited both Humanitas Primary School and Old Kibera School to seek clarity on who I would work with from the school to guide me on the timings the sessions would start, have a conversation on my expectation and outcome, and better internalize how this would impact on the students from their school and as well, how we would work out the logistics on taking measurements of the student's uniforms. 

										To develop the curriculum to be delivered to the identified scholars, I approached four other scholars who study abroad like myself to support brainstorming and draft the concept I had in mind as I shared my vision of what approach I was looking for and the expected impact.
									   We met for four days, spending 2 hours each day, to ensure that we had a clear understanding and mastery of specific areas in the curriculum, enabling us to deliver confidently.
									   For the food packages, we worked with the Shofco team which helped us spot local vendors who could support the delivery of the supplies.

									<p>August 1st 2023 was the first day of the mentorship sessions with the kids. Throughout the week, we tackeled topics like Effective Communication, Mental Health and Healthy Relationships. I taught most of the lessons in Swahili to make sure I was making my point clear and easy for the fourth graders to understand. Thorughout the lessons, I would give them an example of a scenario that they would use their skills in and ask them to give me a different example of when they think they would be using their newly acquired skills. This helped me gauge how much of the content they had retained and how much time I would spend reviewing it the next day. This was easier to do since we had learning objectives and guiding questions to lead us each day. We would end the sessions by playing games like Simon says.  </p>

										This Project</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/IMG_5772.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The future of this project is huge. I intend to keep fundraising and do this again next summer. I would like to be able to secure a full set of uniforms, including shoes, for each student spotted. I would also like to expand the school curriculum to touch on topics like sexual reproductive health rights, drugs, and substance abuse, and how to develop an independent mindset. I believe this as well as the already tackled topics are critically important topics to learn about, especially when living in the ghetto. I believe there is more that can be done. I aspire to inspire as many kids in Kibera as possible to keep following their dreams and to break the cycle of poverty in their families. Doing something in my community has enabled me to look beyond the impossibilities that others may spot in the slum areas but rather identify the opportunity I have to make an impact by contributing positively to the change that I hope to see in the future. Kibera counts on us (my fellow scholars and I) who got chances to acquire quality education to be the change agents in the future. I can affirm that I am making this a reality because I know where much is given, much more is expected.
